Regarding bed linens and towels things get more tricky in such remote locations. It is practically impossible for us to change linens or towels between each stay, as it takes us a full day to travel in and back from Oslo. Therefore guests either have to bring their own or a silk sleeping bag liner. Alternatively you could stop by our house on the way and we can provide you with both.

When one wants uniqueness and remoteness in the wild, miles from civilization, these are some of the comforts it is not possible to supply, unfortunately.
