I just wanted to point you to an informational  site for the cabin. It's in Norwegian, but you'll be able to find some good resources, including driving instructons and maps, as well as an instruction manual in English that covers almost anything one could think of.

If you fancy having a look at the info, just search for "holmevann Kopseng" online. It's the non-airbnb hit.

The address is http://holmevann.kopseng.no, but the url is usually prevented from showing until the day before arrival, so you can also just search for it.
