To fish anything in Eggedal you need a licence, which you aquire for a weekend for about 50kr, through buying a licence ("fishing card"). These can be bought using the mobile app Angler ID, which is available for iOS (iPhone) and Android. 

You can also buy physical fishing cards from the tourist info in Eggedal or Solbua in Prestfoss. The tourist office is very flexible, and they can arrange for the cards to be picked up out-of-hours.

Solbua in Prestfoss and a shop in Eggedal both supply fresh/live maggots/worms for fishing.

Generally, you'll find plenty of sik and some trout. The sik is mostly living in the middle of the lake, whereas the trout likes it near the shore, where it is not so deep. It especially likes to swim up small creeks, so check out the old map in the cabin for where there is/was old creeks running into Holmevann. I think you should find some along the Northern and Eastern bank of the lake.

Please observe that you are not allowed to use the boat house (or the boat therein) in the little red cabin next to ours!
